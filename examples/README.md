# bulls_and_cows.a60

Game [bulls and cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows).

    $ x1sim bulls_and_cows.a60
    Welcome to bulls and cows

    I choose a number made of 4 digits (from 0 to 9) without repetitions.
    You enter a number of 4 digits, and I say you how many of them
    are in my secret number but in wrong position (cows),
    and how many are in the right position (bulls).

    Guess a number.
    Enter number: 3210
    You scored 0 bulls and 2 cows.
    Guess a number.
    Enter number: 5304
    You scored 0 bulls and 2 cows.
    Guess a number.
    Enter number: 4631
    You scored 0 bulls and 3 cows.
    Guess a number.
    Enter number: 1473
    You scored 1 bulls and 2 cows.
    Guess a number.
    Enter number: 8143
    You scored 3 bulls and 0 cows.
    Guess a number.
    Enter number: 9143
    You scored 4 bulls and 0 cows.
    Correct. That took you 6 guesses.

# sieve.a60

Sieve of Eratosthenes: calculating prime numbers up to a million. The trick is that the original Electrologica X1 machine had only 32 kilowords of memory, and such a program would not fit. But on the simulator we made the stack 1 megaword, why not.
